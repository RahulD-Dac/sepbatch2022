String Coding Questions:
1. How to Print duplicate characters from String?
2. For example, if String is "Java" then the program should print "a"
3. How to check if two Strings are anagrams of each other? 
4. How to program to print the first non repeated character from String? 
5. How to check if a String contains only digits? 
6. How to find duplicate characters in a String? 
7. You need to write a program to print all duplicate character and their count in Java. For 
example, if given String is "Programming" then your program should print
g : 2
r : 2
m : 2
8. How to count the occurrence of a given character in String?
9. How to convert numeric String to an int?
10. For example, if you pass "67263" to the program then it should return 67263.
11. How to replace each given character to other e.g. blank with %20? 
12. For example, if the input is "Java is Great" and asked to replace space with %20 then it 
should be "Java%20is%20Great".
13. How to find all permutations of String?
14. How to reverse words in a sentence without using a library method?
15. How to remove duplicate characters from String?
16. For example, if the input is ‘bananas’ the output will be ‘bans’.
17. How to check if a String is a valid shuffle of two String?
18. For example, given first = "abc" and second = "def", third = "dabecf" is a valid shuffle 
since it preserves the character ordering of the two strings.
19. How to return the highest occurred character in a String?
For example if input is "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbcddddeeeeee" it should return "a".
20. Write a program to remove a given character from String?
21. You need to write a Java method that will accept a String and a character to be removed 
and return a String, which doesn't has that character e.g remove(String word, char ch).
22. Write a program to find the longest palindrome in a string?
23. How to sort String on their length in Java? 
24. Write a Program to sort String on their length in Java? Your method should accept an 
array of String and return a sorted array based upon the length of String. Don't forget to 
write unit tests for your solution.
25. This question is asked by Facebook. Given a string, return whether or not it forms a 
palindrome ignoring case and non-alphabetical characters.
